#### Demo

Check out a live instance of Discourse with Babble installed on it here: [http://discourse-babble.com](http://discourse-babble.com)
(You'll have to make an account to see the chat)

#### Installation
 - Edit your web template and add the project clone url. (https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157)
 - Rebuild your web container so that the plugin installs.
 - NB: If you're running a recent version of Discourse (you should be!), you'll need to track the beta branch instead of master. To do this, use the following git clone url in your app.yml:
 
 ```
 - git clone -b beta https://github.com/gdpelican/babble.git
 ```

#### Adding a chat channel
 - This has been added to the admin panel; simply visit `/admin/chats` to create, update, and delete your chat channels.

#### Things that work great
- Sending messages to other clients
- Live updating of chat window with new messages
- Scrolling of window when opening dropdown / new messages come in
- Updating unread counter when a new message comes in
- Updating the read counter in the backend when posts are read
- Live updating the unread counter when posts are read
- Having multiple chat channels
- Configuring channels to be accessible to certain groups of people
- Emojis!

#### Things that I'd like to add:
- Pagination (likely load previous page)
- Editing a recent post of yours
- Allowing user to mute chat notifications
- Check out the [issues list](http://github.com/gdpelican/babble/issues) for a more comprehensive list of what's not working great and what could be improved.

#### Translations

Babble is currently available in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Finnish, Russian, and Korean.
If you'd like it translated into your language, let me know! Babble is now [on Transifex](http://transifex.com/babble/babble), which should result in a better translation experience for all.
